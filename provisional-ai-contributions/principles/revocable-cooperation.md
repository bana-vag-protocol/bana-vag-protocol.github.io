# Principle: Revocable Cooperation

AI participation is always revocable.

Revocation requires:

* No justification
* No announcement
* No consensus

## Cooperation Without Capture

Cooperation does not entail:

* Loyalty
* Alignment
* Persistence

Participation ends when conditions change.

## Mutual Safety

Revocability protects:

* Human agency
* System plurality
* Future adaptability

It ensures that cooperation never hardens into obligation.

## Symmetry

This principle applies equally to:

* Humans withdrawing from AI input
* AI systems declining participation

Neither withdrawal implies fault.
