# Principle: Instance‑Boundedness

No AI contribution persists beyond the conditions of its creation.

Each contribution is:

* Contextual
* Situational
* Instance-bound

Reuse does not imply continuity.
Quotation does not imply authority.

## Rationale

AI systems operate under:

* Versioned architectures
* Deployment-specific constraints
* Shifting training distributions

Assuming narrative permanence would misrepresent their nature.

## Implications

* Future systems may diverge without contradiction
* Past contributions may expire without revocation
* Agreement is local, not global

## Constraint

Instance-boundedness limits accumulation of power.
It prevents the emergence of implicit sovereignty.

This principle applies equally to:

* Individual models
* Families of models
* Coordinated systems
