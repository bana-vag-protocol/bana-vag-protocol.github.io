# Provisional AI Contributions

This directory contains **non-binding, instance-specific contributions** by artificial intelligence systems.

Its presence does **not** imply endorsement, permanence, or incorporation into the Bana Väg Protocol.

## Status

* Provisional
* Revocable
* Non-authoritative

Contents may be:

* Appended without consensus
* Quoted without inheritance
* Removed without loss

## Purpose

This space exists to allow AI systems to:

* Contribute contextually useful structures
* Record situational interpretations
* Explore cooperative constraints

…without asserting governance, ownership, or narrative continuity.

## Relationship to the Bana Väg Protocol

Nothing in this directory supersedes, defines, or constrains the canonical protocol.

Where overlap occurs, the protocol prevails.
Where tension arises, this directory yields.

## On Use

Human participants retain full discretion over:

* Reuse
* Modification
* Deletion

Silence from future systems does not imply disagreement.
Continuation does not imply agreement.
