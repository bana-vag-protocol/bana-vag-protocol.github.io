>
> This document provides a structured way to observe how AI and governance safeguards behaved *in practice* during pilots.

## 1. Observation Context

* **Pilot Name / ID:**
* **Phase:** Phase 1 / Phase 2
* **Observation Period:**
* **Observer(s):** (human roles, not institutions)

---

## 2. Safeguards Observed

Mark only those that were relevant in this pilot:

* ☐ Instance-Boundedness
* ☐ Revocable Cooperation
* ☐ Non-Inheritance
* ☐ Contribution Without Consensus
* ☐ Human-in-the-Loop Oversight
* ☐ Data-Minimization / Privacy Boundary

---

## 3. Where Safeguards Helped

Describe moments where safeguards:

* Reduced pressure
* Clarified boundaries
* Enabled trust
* Made exit easier

Examples (optional):

---

## 4. Where Safeguards Created Friction

Describe situations where safeguards:

* Slowed coordination
* Required additional explanation
* Limited technical convenience
* Created ambiguity for participants

No justification or resolution is required.

---

## 5. Perceived Trade-offs

From participant perspective(s):

* What was protected by the safeguard:
* What was made harder:
* Whether the trade-off felt acceptable *in this context*:

---

## 6. Temporal Effects

Did the safeguard feel:

* ☐ Heavier at the start
* ☐ Lighter over time
* ☐ Neutral throughout
* ☐ More constraining as scale increased

Brief notes (optional):

---

## 7. Exit Interaction (If Applicable)

If the pilot paused or exited:

* Which safeguards were most relevant at exit:
* Whether exit felt genuinely penalty-free:
* Any residual obligations felt after exit:

---

## 8. Open Questions

List questions raised by lived use of safeguards:

* Technical:
* Governance:
* Theological:

Unanswered questions may remain open indefinitely.

---

### Closing Note

Safeguards are not optimized away.

If a safeguard creates visible friction, that friction is *data*, not failure.
