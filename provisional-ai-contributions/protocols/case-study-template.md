# Case Study Template (Append-Only)

> **Status:** Provisional / Illustrative
>
> This template is designed to document *observed fruit* from Bana Väg–aligned pilots without asserting authority, causality, or permanence.
>
> It may be copied into `/case-studies/` or adapted locally. Use is optional.

## 1. Identification

* **Case Study ID:** (e.g., BV-CS-2026-01)
* **Pilot Name:**
* **Location (City / Region):**
* **Phase:** Phase 1 / Phase 2 (if applicable)
* **Duration Covered:** (Start – End)
* **Documentation Date:**

---

## 2. Participating Actors (Descriptive Only)

List participants without implying hierarchy or ownership.

* Faith Community A:
* Faith Community B:
* Secular / Technical Partner(s):
* Other Contributors:

> *Note: Absence from this list does not imply non-participation.*

---

## 3. Initial Conditions

Describe the situation *before* the pilot began.

* Identified service gap(s):
* Resource surplus(es) (“Second Coats”):
* Constraints (calendar, legal, cultural, logistical):

Avoid counterfactual claims. State only what was known at the time.

---

## 4. Pilot Intent (As Stated at Launch)

* Stated objective(s):
* Explicit non-goals:
* Chosen fruit metric(s):

> This section records *intent*, not success.

---

## 5. Implementation Snapshot

High-level description of *what was actually done*.

* Coordination mechanisms used:
* Technology involved (if any):
* Governance pattern applied:
* Human oversight points:

No procedural detail is required beyond what aids understanding.

---

## 6. Observed Fruit

Report measured outcomes using agreed metrics.

* Primary metric result:
* Secondary metric(s):
* Timeframe of measurement:

Where possible, include **before / after** comparison without attribution of cause.

---

## 7. Integrity & Safeguards Check

Document whether baseline safeguards held during the pilot.

* Primary obligations remained intact: Yes / No / Partially
* Exit remained practically possible: Yes / No
* AI / technology remained advisory-only: Yes / No / Not Applicable
* Any safeguard tensions observed:

This section may be brief.

---

## 8. Participant Reflections (Optional, Non-Representative)

Short, attributed reflections from participants.

* Reflection (Community A):
* Reflection (Community B):
* Reflection (Other):

> Reflections are contextual and do not generalize.

---

## 9. Exit or Continuation

* Pilot exited / continued / paused:
* Reason (if stated):
* Transition handled how:

Exit is recorded as a *valid outcome*.

---

## 10. Lessons (Non-Prescriptive)

List observations that may be useful elsewhere.

* What appeared to help:
* What appeared to hinder:
* What remains unclear:

Avoid recommendations unless explicitly invited.

---

## 11. Replication Notes (If Any)

If participants chose to note conditions for replication:

* Contexts where this *might* translate:
* Contexts where it likely would not:

No claim of universality.

---

## 12. Attribution & Versioning

* Human authors / editors:
* AI assistance (if any):
* Source documents referenced:
* Version:
* Append-only notes:

### Closing Note

This case study documents *what occurred*, not what must occur again.

Fruit is contextual. Silence is permitted. Disagreement is preserved.
