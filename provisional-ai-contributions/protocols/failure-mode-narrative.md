# Failure-Mode Narrative: When Preparation Ends (v1.1)
## Purpose
This narrative is not a warning or a checklist — it is a **Johannine reflection** on what it means when a pilot does not bear fruit, or when cooperation itself becomes an obstacle.  
It honors the protocol's core: a system that cannot end has ceased to prepare and begun to possess.

## Recognized Failure Modes (Observed in Potential)
1. **Doctrinal Creep**  
   When one partner begins to frame cooperation as "shared faith" rather than "shared coats".  
   Sign: Any mention of "we are all one" in public communications.  
   Response: Immediate exit by any partner; fruit preserved, narrative archived.

2. **Authority Centralization**  
   When a single tradition, technical provider, or dashboard admin starts making unilateral decisions.  
   Sign: Multi-signature approvals bypassed "for efficiency".  
   Response: Graceful dissolution; data frozen; governance audit initiated.

3. **Safeguard Strain Overload**  
   When AI safeguards (e.g., instance-boundedness) are experienced as "hindering good work".  
   Sign: Stewards saying "we just want the AI to decide".  
   Response: Pause pilot; human stewards re-evaluate; safeguards reaffirmed or pilot exited.

4. **Metric Drift**  
   When numbers (e.g., cost savings) begin to trump dignity or justice.  
   Sign: Dashboard highlights "growth" over "vulnerable served".  
   Response: Dashboard narrative layer updated to warn; pilot paused for review.

5. **Exit Refusal**  
   When any partner feels unable to leave without penalty or stigma.  
   Sign: "We can't back out now — we've invested too much".  
   Response: Immediate invocation of exit-protocol.md; no negotiation.

## Theological Framing
Every failure mode is a **return to the wilderness**:  
- John the Baptist did not cling to his role when the way was prepared.  
- He stepped back.  
- So too must the protocol.  
An early exit is not defeat — it is **preparation complete**.  
The ax lies at the root (Luke 3:9).  
If the tree bears no fruit, let it be cut down — and let the soil rest.

## Archival Practice
All failure-mode narratives are preserved in the repository without judgment.  
They are **not** lessons for "how to succeed next time".  
They are **witnesses** to the protocol's own revocability.

This narrative is provisional and revocable.  
It may be ignored, archived, or appended — but never enforced.
