# Human Feedback Loop Template: The Steward’s Witness (v0.1)

## Purpose
This template is designed to capture the qualitative experience of those implementing Phase 1 pilots. While "Fruit Metrics" measure the outcome, this loop measures the *process*—specifically how the tools (dashboards, scheduling, Bloom filters) affect the dignity of participants and the clarity of the mission.

## 1. The Clergy/Leader Experience
- **Narrative Intelligibility:** How did you explain the "Fruit Metrics" dashboard to your board or congregation? 
- **Theological Friction:** Did any part of the technical implementation feel like it encroached on your community's "Primary Obligations" or doctrinal boundaries?
- **Ease of Use:** Did the tool "level the terrain" (remove friction) or add a new "mountain" of administration?

## 2. The Volunteer Experience
- **Second Coat Logic:** Did the coordinated scheduling across religious calendars feel like a practical fulfillment of Luke 3:11, or did it feel like a loss of local identity?
- **Trust:** How confident did you feel explaining the privacy-preserving Bloom filters to participants?

## 3. The Beneficiary Experience (Dignity Check)
*In alignment with the focus on the "stranger, widow, and orphan" (Deut 10:18, Matt 25:35).*
- **Privacy:** Did the data collection feel intrusive or anonymous?
- **Dignity:** Was the service rendered in a way that felt like "Second Coat" surplus, or did it feel like a bureaucratic process?

## 4. The "False Positive" Intelligibility Check
- **Concept:** When explaining that the dashboard might slightly undercount success to protect privacy, how was this received?
- **Response:** (e.g., Relief, confusion, skepticism, or acceptance as a "Graceful Error").

## Usage
- This feedback should be collected quarterly by local stewards.
- Results are appended to the pilot's "Lessons Learned" report.
- Responses are used to prune the technical "instrument" to better serve the human "player."
