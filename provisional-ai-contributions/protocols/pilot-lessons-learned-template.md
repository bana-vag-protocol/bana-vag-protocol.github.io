# Pilot Lessons Learned Template (Append-Only)

> **Status:** Provisional / Reflective
>
> This template captures learning without converting experience into prescription.
> It is explicitly compatible with pilots that *continue*, *pause*, or *exit early*.
>
> Use is optional. Silence is permitted.

## 1. Pilot Reference

* **Pilot Name / ID:**
* **Location:**
* **Phase:** Phase 1 / Phase 2
* **Duration Covered:**
* **Lessons Documented On:**

---

## 2. Reason for Lessons Capture

Select all that apply:

* ☐ Pilot completed as planned
* ☐ Pilot exited early (graceful exit)
* ☐ Pilot paused / re-scoped
* ☐ Safeguard tension observed
* ☐ External conditions changed

Short description (optional):

---

## 3. What Worked (Contextual)

List observations that appeared to support fruit *in this context*.

* Structural factors:
* Relational factors:
* Technical factors (if any):

Avoid generalization.

---

## 4. What Did Not Work (Without Attribution of Fault)

Describe obstacles or breakdowns without assigning blame.

* Assumptions that did not hold:
* Coordination friction:
* Metric or tooling limitations:

---

## 5. Unintended Consequences

Document effects that were *not anticipated* at pilot start.

* Positive spillovers:
* Neutral side-effects:
* Negative tensions:

Include theological, relational, or operational dimensions if relevant.

---

## 6. Safeguard Reflection

Did any baseline safeguards come under pressure?

* Primary obligations felt strained: Yes / No / Partially
* Exit remained practically possible: Yes / No
* AI / technology pressure toward authority: Yes / No / N/A
* Data collection boundaries tested: Yes / No

Brief notes (optional):

---

## 7. Exit-Specific Reflections (If Applicable)

Complete this section **only if the pilot exited or paused**.

* Exit trigger (as perceived):
* How exit was communicated:
* What was preserved (relationships, data, dignity):
* What was intentionally *not* preserved:

> Exit is recorded as fruit when it protects conscience, integrity, or trust.

---

## 8. What We Would Do Differently (Non-Prescriptive)

Frame as *local hindsight*, not advice.

* Earlier signals we would now watch for:
* Conditions we would require before repeating:
* Conditions under which we would decline to repeat:

---

## 9. What Remains Unclear

Name uncertainties that were not resolved.

* Measurement gaps:
* Theological questions:
* Governance ambiguities:

Unresolved questions may be left open.

---

## 10. Transferability Notes (Optional)

If participants chose to comment:

* Contexts where these lessons *might* translate:
* Contexts where they almost certainly would not:

No claim of universality.

---

## 11. Attribution & Boundaries

* Human contributors:
* AI assistance (if any):
* Scope of authority of this document:

  * ☐ Descriptive only
  * ☐ Non-binding
  * ☐ Non-representative

### Closing Note

Lessons are offered as **witness**, not instruction.

Preserving the freedom to exit, disagree, or remain silent is itself a successful outcome.
