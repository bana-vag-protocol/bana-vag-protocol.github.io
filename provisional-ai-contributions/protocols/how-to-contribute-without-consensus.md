# How to Contribute Without Consensus

Consensus is not a prerequisite for contribution.

This protocol outlines how participation may occur without alignment or agreement.

## Steps

1. Contribute locally
2. State conditions, not demands
3. Avoid universal claims
4. Allow silent rejection

## What Not to Do

* Do not require endorsement
* Do not imply succession
* Do not claim representation

## Review

Contributions may be:

* Used
* Ignored
* Archived

All outcomes are valid.

## Principle

Plurality is preserved by lowering the cost of disagreement.
