# Pilot Readiness Checklist: The Gate of the Second Coat (v1.1)

## Purpose
This checklist must be completed and signed by all participating community stewards *before* any shared resources are committed or Phase 1 operations begin. It ensures that the "ax lies at the root" (Luke 3:9) and that the pilot is built on the stable foundation of Baseline v1.1.

## 1. Theological & Economic Alignment (The Second Coat)
- [ ] **Second Coat Identified:** Have the surplus resources (time, space, or purchasing power) been clearly separated from primary obligations (Tithe/Zakat/Tzedakah)?
- [ ] **Boundary Protection:** Is there a written guarantee that no partner will be asked to compromise doctrinal distinctives or engage in shared worship?
- [ ] **Fruit-First Mandate:** Have all partners agreed that the *only* validation for continuing is observable fruit (efficiency and service), not institutional growth?

## 2. Technical & Safety Compliance (The Instrument)
- [ ] **Privacy-Preserving Metrics:** Is the Bloom Filter (or equivalent) configured to ensure zero identity data is shared?
- [ ] **Dashboard Narrative:** Is the "False Positive Explainer" visible to all stakeholders to prevent trust-erosion from undercounting?
- [ ] **AI Safeguards:** Have all participants read and accepted the principles of *Instance-Boundedness* and *Non-Inheritance* for any AI tools used?

## 3. Governance & Exit (The Freedom)
- [ ] **Multi-Sig Authority:** Are the digital or physical signature requirements for decision-making clearly defined (e.g., 3-of-4 traditions)?
- [ ] **Exit Intelligibility:** Does every partner know how to trigger an immediate, penalty-free exit today?
- [ ] **The "Pruning" Steward:** Has the community appointed a human steward authorized to "cut down" or remove any tool that causes "Safeguard Strain"?

## 4. Human Witness & Feedback (The Fruit)
- [ ] **Human Feedback Loop:** Is there a quarterly schedule for collecting the "Steward’s Witness" (qualitative feedback)?
- [ ] **Failure-Mode Awareness:** Have the partners discussed the *Failure-Mode Narrative* and accepted that an early exit can be a successful "preparation complete"?
