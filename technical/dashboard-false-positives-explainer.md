# Explaining False Positives on the Fruit Dashboard

> **Audience:** Non-technical (congregants, partners, decision-makers)
>
> **Purpose:** To explain why some numbers are *intentionally conservative* and why that protects people.

## What Does “False Positive” Mean Here?

On this dashboard, a **false positive** does **not** mean a mistake about a person.

It means:

> The system *may think* someone has already been counted, even if they have not.

As a result, the dashboard may count **slightly fewer** people served than actually were.

---

## Why Would We Accept Undercounting?

Because the alternative would require:

* Tracking individuals across communities
* Creating shared identity records
* Accumulating sensitive personal data

That would violate the protocol’s commitments to:

* Dignity
* Privacy
* Non-ownership of people

So we choose a system that:

> **Understates success rather than over-identifies people.**

## A Simple Analogy

Imagine counting coats distributed in a dark room.

If you’re unsure whether someone already has a coat, you might choose **not** to hand out a second one.

You may give out *one fewer coat than possible* — but you avoid taking coats *back* or inspecting people.

The dashboard works the same way.

## What the Numbers Mean (and Don’t Mean)

The dashboard numbers:

* **Mean:** “At least this much fruit was borne.”
* **Do not mean:** “Exactly this many unique individuals were served.”

They are:

* Aggregated
* Conservative
* Instance-bound

## Why This Is Theologically Intentional

Luke 3:13 says:

> “Collect no more than required.”

The dashboard collects:

* Enough to show fruit
* Not enough to control, judge, or possess

---

## What to Do If the Numbers Feel ‘Too Low’

That feeling is itself a signal.

It reminds us that:

* The goal is service, not statistics
* The fruit exists beyond what is counted
* No dashboard can see everything that matters
