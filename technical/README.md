# Technical Architecture: Tools for the Johannine Way

This directory contains specifications for the technical instruments of the Bana Väg Protocol. In alignment with Baseline v1.1, these tools are designed as **preparatory instruments**—they remove obstacles and provide transparency but never exercise moral authority.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Non-Possessive Design:** All core logic is open-source and modular. No single entity owns the coordination data.
2. **Privacy-Preserving:** Client data is protected through aggregation or zero-knowledge principles. We measure "fruit" (outcomes), not individuals.
3. **Interoperable (Moral API):** Systems are designed to connect disparate community databases without requiring a centralized master-record.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Every automated recommendation (e.g., scheduling) is subject to human override by community stewards.

## Component Roadmap

- **Johannine Scheduling Spec:** Calendar coordination across religious observances.
- **Fruit Metrics Transparency:** Privacy-preserving impact tracking.
- **Second Coat Resource Discovery:** Cataloging surplus capacity.
