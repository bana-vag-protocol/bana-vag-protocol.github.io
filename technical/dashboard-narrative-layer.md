# Dashboard Narrative Layer: Making Fruit Visible (v1.1)
## Purpose
The dashboard is not a control panel — it is a **Johannine Instrument** that makes "fruit worthy of repentance" (Luke 3:8) publicly intelligible without claiming authority or replacing human discernment.
It shows aggregated outcomes while preserving privacy, dignity, and theological boundaries.

## Core Narrative Principles
1. **Preparatory, not Possessive**  
   The dashboard removes obstacles to understanding, but never owns or judges the fruit.

2. **Publicly Intelligible**  
   All displays use plain language, avoiding technical jargon or implied causality.

3. **No False Continuity**  
   Data is instance-bound to the pilot. No historical comparisons unless explicitly approved.

4. **Exit-Legible**  
   If a partner exits, their data contribution is gracefully removed from aggregates.

5. **Human Oversight**  
   Every dashboard update requires multi-signature approval (see /governance/).

## Key Display Sections
### 1. Aggregate Fruit Overview
- Total meals provided (aggregated)
- Households stabilized (aggregated)
- Debt relieved (aggregated)
- Efficiency gain (e.g., % overhead reduction)
- Coverage hours across religious calendars

### 2. Bloom Filter Safety Indicator
- "Unique individuals served" (probabilistic estimate with confidence interval)
- False-positive warning: "Slight undercounting possible – better to under-report than over-identify"

### 3. Timeline View
- Weekly/monthly aggregates (no individual tracking)
- Pilot start/end markers (including early exits)

### 4. Governance Transparency
- Last multi-signature approval timestamp
- Current participating traditions
- Exit log (anonymized: "Partner exited on [date]")

### 5. Narrative Disclaimer (always visible)
"This dashboard shows aggregated outcomes of voluntary cooperation.  
It does not imply doctrinal agreement, ownership, or future obligation.  
All data is instance-bound and revocable.  
Let the fruit speak — not the dashboard."
