# Pilot Lessons Learned — Safeguard Strain Appendix (v0.1)

## Purpose

This appendix captures how protocol safeguards behaved under real pilot conditions.

It is **not** an evaluation of people or partners, but of constraints, frictions, and protections built into the system.

---

## 1. Safeguards Tested

Mark all that applied during the pilot:

* [ ] Instance-bounded data collection
* [ ] Bloom filter aggregation
* [ ] No cross-pilot data continuity
* [ ] Multi-signature approval for updates
* [ ] Exit-legibility (data removal on exit)

---

## 2. Where Safeguards Helped

Describe moments where safeguards:

* Prevented over-collection
* Reduced internal pressure to ‘optimize’ people
* Clarified boundaries between partners

**Observed Effects:**

## 3. Where Safeguards Created Friction

Describe moments where safeguards:

* Slowed reporting
* Reduced perceived accuracy
* Caused confusion or frustration

Be concrete.

**Observed Strain:**

---

## 4. Human Workarounds Observed

Did participants:

* Create parallel notes or shadow systems?
* Attempt informal comparisons across weeks or sites?

If yes, describe **why**.

## 5. Discernment Notes (Required)

Reflect on this question:

> Did the safeguard protect something that mattered, even when it felt inconvenient?

**Steward Reflection:**

> *Free text*

## 6. Recommendation for Next Pilot

Choose one:

* [ ] Keep safeguard unchanged
* [ ] Adjust safeguard (describe)
* [ ] Remove safeguard (requires governance review)

**Rationale:**

## Closing Reminder

Safeguards are not failures when they create friction.

They are signals.

This appendix exists to ensure that pressure to scale does not silently erase the very protections the protocol was designed to uphold.
