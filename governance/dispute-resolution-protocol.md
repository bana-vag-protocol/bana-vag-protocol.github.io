# Dispute Resolution Protocol (v1.1)
## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Direct Conversation**
   - Involved parties meet (virtual or physical) within 7 days
   - Goal: Restore understanding

2. **Mediation**
   - Neutral third party (e.g., interfaith council member) facilitates
   - No binding decision – only recommendation

3. **Graceful Dissolution**
   - If unresolved: Pilot exits for affected parties (per exit-protocol.md)
   - Metrics preserved, no stigma

## Triggers for Immediate Dissolution
- Any attempt at doctrinal convergence
- Redirection of primary obligations
- Centralization of authority
- Violation of AI safeguards

## Theological Warrant
Dispute resolution mirrors John the Baptist’s preparatory role: when preparation fails, the system steps back.
