# Governance Documentation: Bana Väg Protocol
This directory contains the governance patterns and protocols for Phase 1 pilots and beyond. All governance is designed to:
- Distribute authority (no "princes" – Psalm 146:3)
- Respect denominational boundaries
- Enable graceful exit
- Align with AI Participation Safeguards (instance-bounded, revocable, non-inheriting)

## Core Principles
1. Multi-Signature Authority – Decisions require cross-tradition consent
2. Penalty-Free Exit – Operationalized in every protocol
3. Transparency – All decisions auditable
4. Human Oversight – No AI or technical system holds veto or final authority
