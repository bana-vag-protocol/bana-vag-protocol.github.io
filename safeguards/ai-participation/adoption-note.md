# Adoption Note: AI Participation Safeguards

These safeguards were adopted into the Bana Väg Protocol by human stewards.

They are:
- Not owned by any AI system
- Not enforced by any AI system
- Not modifiable through AI participation

Artificial intelligence may reference these safeguards but cannot amend them.

This note exists to prevent future ambiguity.
