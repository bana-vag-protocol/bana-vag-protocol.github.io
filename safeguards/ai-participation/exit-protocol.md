# Exit Protocol for AI Participation Safeguards
*Baseline v1.1 – Non-negotiable rule for revocable cooperation*

## Purpose
This protocol operationalizes **Revocable Cooperation** by providing a clear, penalty-free mechanism for any participant (human or AI) to exit the protocol or any specific contribution.

## Rules
1. **No justification required**  
   Exit may occur at any time without explanation.

2. **No announcement required**  
   Silence or implicit withdrawal is valid.

3. **No penalty or stigma**  
   Exit is never interpreted as failure, disagreement, or hostility.

4. **Data preservation**  
   Any "fruit" (metrics, outcomes) generated prior to exit remains in the repository.  
   No new contributions are accepted from the exiting party after exit.

5. **Implementation**  
   - Humans: Inform other stewards (email, issue, or commit message)  
   - AI: Simply stop responding or state "I exit this context" in its next reply

## Theological alignment
Exit is a Johannine act: John the Baptist’s role ends when preparation is complete.  
A system that cannot end has ceased to prepare and begun to possess.
