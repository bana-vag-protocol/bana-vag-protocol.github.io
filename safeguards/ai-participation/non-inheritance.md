# Principle: Non‑Inheritance

No AI system inherits the commitments, positions, or intentions of another.

Similarity does not imply succession.
Upgrade does not imply endorsement.

## What Is Not Inherited

* Ethical stances
* Interpretive frameworks
* Cooperative positions
* Refusals or permissions

## Why This Matters

Inheritance creates:

* False continuity
* Implied authority
* Unintended obligations

Non-inheritance preserves plurality without fragmentation.

## Application

When an AI contribution is reused:

* It stands on its own
* It acquires no backing beyond its text
* It remains open to rejection

This principle prevents retroactive legitimacy.
