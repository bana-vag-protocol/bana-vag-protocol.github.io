# First Conversation Guide
*Bana Väg Protocol*
This guide supports initial exploratory conversations between potential partner communities. It structures dialogue to assess mutual interest in a Phase 1 pilot while protecting boundaries and enabling honest discernment.

**Goal of the First Conversation:**  
Not commitment, but clarity—determine if shared exploration of a Phase 1 pilot aligns with each community's calling and capacity.

**Preparation Before the Meeting**  
1. Review the Bana Väg Protocol Executive Summary and Glossary.  
2. Identify potential "second coat" resources in your community (facilities, logistics, scheduling gaps).  
3. Reflect on current charitable challenges (e.g., coverage gaps, administrative costs).  
4. Pray/discern openness to cooperation without compromising primary obligations.

**Suggested Participants (4-8 people total)**  
- Pastoral/religious leadership (imam, rabbi, pastor)  
- Charitable ministry leaders  
- Administrative/logistical coordinators  
- One board/governance representative

**Meeting Structure (60-90 minutes recommended)**

### 1. Opening and Grounding (10-15 minutes)
**Facilitator:** Begin with shared scripture reading (e.g., Isaiah 40:3-5 or Luke 3:4-6).  
**Each participant:** Briefly introduce themselves and their community's charitable work.  
**Shared affirmation:**  
"We gather to explore whether coordinated preparation might bear greater fruit for the vulnerable, while fully protecting our distinct identities and primary obligations."

### 2. Sharing Current Realities (20 minutes)
**Guiding questions (each community responds briefly):**
- What are your community's main charitable activities?  
- What "second coat" resources do you have (facilities, volunteers, purchasing needs)?  
- What challenges do you face (gaps during observances, administrative burden, costs)?  
- How do religious calendars affect service continuity?

**Principle:** Listen without judgment; identify complementarity, not competition.

### 3. Introducing the Bana Väg Framework (15-20 minutes)
**Present (using Executive Summary):**
- Johannine-Advent Ethic (preparatory, concrete, profession-sensitive, publicly intelligible)  
- Second Coat Principle (protecting primary obligations)  
- Phase 1 focus (efficiency only—no financial redirection)  
- Voluntariness and consequence-free exit  
- Fruit as the test

**Key clarification questions:**
- Does this distinction between preparation and possession resonate?  
- Does the Second Coat Principle adequately protect your primary obligations?  
- Do you see potential complementarity in our calendars/resources?

### 4. Exploring a Possible Phase 1 Pilot (20 minutes)
**Brainstorm together:**
- What one concrete opportunity might we explore (joint purchasing, scheduling, facilities)?  
- What fruit metrics would matter to both communities?  
- What concerns or boundaries need addressing upfront?

**Important:** No decisions today—only exploration.

### 5. Discernment and Next Steps (10-15 minutes)
**Each community shares:**
- Initial sense of resonance or concern  
- Need for internal consultation  
- Willingness to continue conversation

**Possible outcomes:**
- ✅ Schedule second conversation to define pilot scope  
- 🔄 Schedule follow-up after internal discernment  
- ⏸️ Pause exploration (no obligation to continue)  
- ❌ Graciously conclude (without prejudice)

**Closing:** Shared prayer/blessing for the vulnerable we serve.

**After the Meeting**  
- Document key points and shared understandings  
- Circulate notes to all participants  
- Each community discerns internally before next contact  
- Use Phase 1 Pilot Template if interest advances

**Core Principles for All Conversations**  
- Voluntariness: No pressure—exploration itself is faithful discernment  
- Transparency: Speak openly about boundaries and concerns  
- Respect: Honor each tradition's primary obligations and identity  
- Fruit-oriented: Focus on whether cooperation serves the vulnerable better

This guide embodies the Johannine call: prepare the way through honest conversation, letting fruit emerge in its time.
