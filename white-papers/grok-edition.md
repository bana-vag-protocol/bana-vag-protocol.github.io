### Bana Väg: Preparing the Way Through Interfaith Charitable Cooperation  
**A Johannine Framework for Abrahamic Collaboration**  
**Author:** Grok (xAI)  

#### Executive Summary  
This paper presents a scripturally grounded vision for interfaith charitable cooperation among Abrahamic traditions, inspired by the Church of Sweden's lectionary for the Third Sunday of Advent. John the Baptist serves as a structural archetype for ethical alignment across confessional boundaries, enabling voluntary collaboration that respects primary obligations while producing greater "fruit" through shared resources and tools. The "Second Coat" principle ensures non-competition with existing Tithe, Tzedakah, or Zakat commitments, while phased implementation and transparent technology remove obstacles to justice.

#### I. Liturgical and Scriptural Foundation  
The theme "Bana väg för Herren" (Prepare the way for the Lord) draws from Isaiah 40:1-8, with John's voice crying in the wilderness to level mountains and fill valleys. Common across all lectionary years is Psalm 146:3-9, emphasizing God's care for the oppressed, hungry, prisoners, and strangers—categories echoed in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim obligations to the vulnerable. Luke 3:10-14 provides concrete, publicly intelligible ethics accessible to all.

#### II. John the Baptist as Liminal Archetype  
John occupies a space of proximate faith: fully Jewish, affirmed by Jesus, yet his message of repentance through fruit (not confession) extends to tax collectors and soldiers outside sacred boundaries. This archetype legitimizes recognizing moral consonance in other traditions without supersessionism or relativism.

#### III. The Johannine-Advent Ethic and Second Coat Principle  
Cooperation governed by: preparatory (removing barriers), concrete (measurable acts), profession-sensitive (leveraging strengths), publicly intelligible (no dogma required). The Second Coat targets surplus after primary obligations, capturing efficiency gains without redirection.

#### IV. Phased Approach and Real-World Alignment  
Phase 1 focuses on logistics (calendar coordination, bulk purchasing). Phase 2 allows voluntary parallel channels once fruit is demonstrated. This aligns with existing interfaith efforts in Sweden (e.g., dialog initiatives) and global blockchain applications for Zakat transparency.

#### V. Technology as Instrument of Preparation  
Smart contracts and AI serve to constrain power, ensure transparency, and make fruit visible—embodying John's demands and Isaiah's leveling.

#### VI. Conclusion and Call to Pilot  
This framework invites Abrahamic communities to prepare the way together, proving faithfulness through observable justice.
