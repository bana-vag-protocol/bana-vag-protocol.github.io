# Executive Summary v1.1
## Preparing the Way: The Johannine-Advent Framework for Interfaith Cooperation
**Version:** 1.1 (Stable Baseline with AI Safeguards)  
**Date:** Third Sunday of Advent, 2025  
**Contributing Models:** Gemini, Claude, Grok, ChatGPT

### What This Framework Is
The Bana Väg Protocol provides a theologically grounded, practically tested structure for interfaith charitable cooperation that:
- Respects doctrinal boundaries while producing measurable outcomes
- Protects primary religious obligations through the "Second Coat" principle
- Tests cooperation through fruit rather than imposing it through authority
- Distributes power to prevent any single tradition or actor from dominating

It is rooted in the figure of **John the Baptist** as interpreted through Advent lectionary readings—a structural archetype for those who prepare the way without claiming to possess it.

### Three Foundational Pillars
#### 1. Johannine-Advent Ethic (Theological Foundation)
John the Baptist occupied a biblically legitimate space adjacent to rather than preliminary to Christian revelation. This creates space for:
- Moral recognizability across confessional boundaries
- Cooperation without covenantal compromise
- Fruit-based validation instead of doctrinal consensus

#### 2. Second Coat Principle (Economic Logic)
"Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none" (Luke 3:11)  
- First coat = Primary denominational obligations  
- Second coat = Systemic surplus from coordination  
Cooperation targets administrative overhead, purchasing power, calendar complementarity, and infrastructure utilization — without touching primary obligations.

#### 3. AI Participation Safeguards (Protective Framework)
Permanent, non-negotiable constraints on artificial intelligence participation:
1. Instance-Boundedness  
2. Non-Inheritance  
3. Revocable Cooperation  
4. Contribution Without Consensus  
5. When Not to Contribute  

AI participates only as a bounded, revocable instrument — never as a "prince" (Psalm 146:3).

### Shared Fruit Metrics
Concrete, observable outcomes across traditions:  
- Food security, housing stability, medical access  
- Debt relief, migrant support, prison reentry  
- Efficiency gains (overhead reduction, gap coverage)  

All metrics are concrete, publicly intelligible, profession-sensitive, transparent, and independently verifiable.

### Governance Structure
- Multi-signature authority across traditions  
- Voluntary entry/exit  
- Technology as Johannine instrument (smart contracts, AI scheduling, dashboards)  
- Human oversight maintained

### Implementation Pathway
**Phase 1:** Efficiency only (logistics, purchasing, scheduling)  
**Phase 2:** Voluntary parallel channel — only after Phase 1 proves superior fruit

### Failure Conditions
The framework fails if:  
1. Doctrinal boundaries blur  
2. Primary obligations are redirected  
3. Authority centralizes  
4. Exit becomes impossible  
5. Growth trumps justice

### Next Steps for Communities
1. Recognize the Johannine-Advent Ethic  
2. Identify "second coat" resources  
3. Commit to Phase 1 for 6–12 months  
4. Measure fruit honestly  
5. Adjust or exit based on results

### The Johannine Test
"Let the fruit speak."  
This framework lives or dies by observable outcomes.
