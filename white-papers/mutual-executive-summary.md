### The Problem John Names  
Religious communities are scripturally mandated to systematic charity (Tithe, Tzedakah, Zakat), yet silos create inefficiencies: duplicated overhead, service gaps during observances, missed bulk savings. In an era of logistical abundance, these barriers hinder greater justice for the vulnerable—hungry, indebted, strangers (Psalm 146:7–9).  

The Third Sunday of Advent readings call not for more reflection, but for preparation: "Bana väg för Herren" (Isaiah 40)—leveling mountains of waste, filling valleys of gaps.

### What the Protocol Is—and Is Not  
The Bana Väg Protocol is a voluntary framework for Abrahamic (and "God-fearing") communities to coordinate surplus resources, rooted in John the Baptist as structural archetype: preparatory ethics without possessive claims.  

It **is**:  
- Cooperation on logistics and efficiency (Phase 1), optional pooling (Phase 2).  
- Governed by visible fruit, not shared doctrine.  

It **is not**:  
- Doctrinal synthesis or shared worship.  
- Redirection of primary obligations.  
- Permanent institution or salvific claim.

### The Johannine-Advent Ethic  
John's ministry provides the governing logic:  
1. **Preparatory, not possessive** — Remove obstacles; do not own outcomes.  
2. **Concrete, not symbolic** — Share coats, restrain power (Luke 3:11–14).  
3. **Profession-sensitive** — Differentiated roles leverage strengths (e.g., Islamic anti-usury expertise, Christian facilities).  
4. **Publicly intelligible** — Fruit visible to all flesh (Isaiah 40:5).  

### The Second Coat Principle  
From Luke 3:11: The "first coat" protects primary giving within communities. The "second coat" captures systemic surplus unlocked by coordination—idle facilities, administrative savings, calendar complementarity—without competition.

### How It Works  
**Phase 1 (Efficiency Only)**: Shared purchasing, scheduling across Shabbat/Sunday/Jumu'ah, joint logistics. No financial redirection; measurable gains in reach/cost.  

**Phase 2 (Voluntary Parallel)**: Only after proven fruit; opt-in additional channel for surplus funds, jointly governed.  

Technology serves as instrument: transparency dashboards, multi-signature decisions, AI coordination—constraining power (Psalm 146), making fruit visible.

### Safeguards and Failure Conditions  
Non-negotiables: Voluntariness, distributed authority, second-coat only, public metrics.  

Fails if: Doctrinal pressure emerges, exit costs arise, growth trumps justice, or fruit remains invisible.

### Success: The Fruit Test  
Measured concretely: meals served, debts relieved, strangers supported, overhead reduced. Validated across traditions; tested in pilots.  

John's ax lies at the root (Luke 3:9). This protocol succeeds only if cooperation bears greater fruit than isolation—for the vulnerable, not institutions.

### Invitation  
Start small: One partner, one surplus opportunity, one measured outcome. Let visible justice speak.  

On this Gaudete Sunday, joy arises when preparation yields fruit. The way is leveled. Will we walk it?
