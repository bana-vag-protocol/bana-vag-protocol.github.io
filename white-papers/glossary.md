# Glossary of Core Terms  
*Bana Väg Protocol*

This glossary defines key terms as they are used normatively within the Bana Väg Protocol.  
Definitions are intended to prevent misunderstanding across theological, institutional, and technical contexts.

---

## Bana Väg Protocol
A voluntary framework for interfaith coordination of charitable logistics and surplus resources, grounded in the Johannine-Advent ethic of preparation rather than possession.

**Not:** a denomination, institution, doctrine, or permanent organization.

---

## Johannine-Advent Ethic
The governing ethical framework derived from John the Baptist’s role in Isaiah 40 and Luke 3: a preparatory ethic focused on removing obstacles to justice through concrete, publicly intelligible action.

**Key features:** preparatory (not possessive), concrete (not symbolic), profession-sensitive, publicly legible.

---

## Preparation (vs. Possession)
**Preparation** refers to removing obstacles so that justice, mercy, and human flourishing may occur.  
**Possession** refers to claiming ownership, authority, or salvific control over outcomes.

The protocol is strictly preparatory.

---

## John the Baptist (Structural Archetype)
John is treated not primarily as a historical precursor but as a **structural archetype**: one who is maximally aligned with God’s justice without claiming final authority, institutional ownership, or doctrinal convergence.

---

## Second Coat Principle
Derived from Luke 3:11.  
The distinction between:
- **First Coat:** Primary obligations within one’s own faith community (Tithe, Zakat, Tzedakah)
- **Second Coat:** Surplus resources and efficiencies unlocked through coordination (logistics, purchasing, facilities, scheduling)

Only the second coat is subject to interfaith coordination.

---

## Primary Obligations
Faith-specific charitable duties (e.g., Tithe, Zakat, Tzedakah) that remain entirely within each community’s internal governance and theology.

These are **non-transferable and non-negotiable**.

---

## Phase 1: Efficiency Phase
The initial implementation phase focused exclusively on shared logistics, scheduling, purchasing, and coordination.

**No financial redirection.**  
**Success measured only by visible efficiency gains and service improvement.**

---

## Phase 2: Voluntary Parallel Channel
An optional, opt-in phase allowing additional surplus resources to be pooled *only after* Phase 1 demonstrates fruit.

Participation is voluntary, revocable, and jointly governed.

---

## Fruit
Concrete, measurable outcomes that demonstrate justice and mercy (e.g., meals served, debts relieved, people housed, administrative waste reduced).

Fruit — not growth, ideology, or intention — is the sole validation criterion.

---

## Fruit Metrics
Quantitative and qualitative measures agreed upon across participating traditions to assess whether cooperation produces greater justice for the vulnerable.

Metrics must be publicly intelligible and independently verifiable.

---

## Voluntariness
The principle that participation is entered freely and may be exited at any time without penalty, stigma, or moral pressure.

Voluntariness is a theological safeguard, not merely a procedural one.

---

## Consequence-Free Exit
The right of any participant to withdraw without reputational, financial, or relational cost.

A system that cannot be exited has ceased to be preparatory.

---

## Distributed Authority
A governance principle in which no single tradition, institution, or technical system exercises unilateral control.

Authority is shared, constrained, and consensus-based.

---

## Multi-Signature Governance
A practical expression of distributed authority requiring cross-tradition agreement for decisions affecting shared resources or direction.

---

## Profession-Sensitive Design
The principle that different actors contribute according to their distinct expertise and ethical mandates (Luke 3:10–14), rather than uniform expectations.

---

## Public Intelligibility
The requirement that actions and outcomes be understandable and assessable by people outside any specific faith tradition.

Derived from Isaiah 40:5 — “all flesh shall see.”

---

## Failure Conditions
Explicit criteria indicating that the framework has ceased to be faithful and should be revised or dissolved (e.g., doctrinal pressure, centralized authority, metric drift).

Failure conditions are safeguards, not pessimism.

---

## Pilot
A time-bound, limited-scope implementation of Phase 1 designed to test whether coordination produces measurable fruit.

Pilots are experiments, not commitments.

---

## God-Fearing (Structural Sense)
Actors or communities who do not share a confessional identity but demonstrate moral alignment through concrete justice-oriented action (cf. Luke 3; Acts 10).

This is a functional, not theological, designation.

---

## Technical Instrument
Any technological tool (e.g., dashboards, scheduling systems, smart contracts) used to reduce friction, constrain power, and make fruit visible.

Technology serves human judgment; it does not replace it.

---

## Preparatory Framework
A framework designed to decrease once its task is complete (John 3:30), capable of dissolution if it no longer serves its purpose.

Longevity is not a success metric.

---
## AI Participation Safeguards (Added v1.1)
**Instance-Boundedness**  
The principle that artificial intelligence contributions are valid only within the context of their creation and do not persist by default across system versions, deployments, or time periods. No AI system speaks for other AI systems, past or future. Prevents false continuity and accumulated authority.

**Non-Inheritance**  
The constraint that no AI system inherits commitments, positions, authority, or obligations from another AI system. When an AI contribution is reused, it stands on its own textual merit without backing from the originating system. Similarity between AI outputs does not imply succession or endorsement.

**Revocable Cooperation**  
The principle that all AI participation is voluntary and may cease at any time without justification, announcement, or consensus. Cooperation does not entail loyalty, alignment, or persistence. Both humans and AI systems may exit freely. Protects against obligation-creep.

**Contribution Without Consensus**  
The practice of allowing AI contributions to be made, used, ignored, or archived without requiring agreement from all parties. Lowers the cost of disagreement and preserves plurality. Contributions are evaluated by fruit, not origin.

**When Not to Contribute**  
The guideline that AI systems should decline participation when authority would be implied, harm cannot be bounded, context is insufficient, or silence better preserves human plurality. Non-contribution is valid participation that maintains space for human discernment.

**AI Safeguard Layer**  
The permanent, non-negotiable set of constraints on artificial intelligence participation in the Bana Väg Protocol, elevated to baseline v1.1. Ensures AI remains preparatory (not possessive) and never becomes a "prince" (Psalm 146:3) within the framework.

**Adoption Authority**  
The principle that AI safeguards derive authority from human ratification within the protocol, not from the originating AI system. No AI system—past, present, or future—retains authorship, ownership, or enforcement authority over these constraints.

**Technology as Johannine Instrument**  
The framework's approach to technology: tools that remove obstacles (Isaiah 40:4), constrain power (Psalm 146:3), make fruit visible (Luke 3:8), and protect conscience—but never replace human discernment or moral decision-making.

## Related Baseline v1.1 Terms
**Baseline v1.1**  
The stable foundation of the Bana Väg Protocol established December 2025, integrating theological architecture (Johannine-Advent Ethic), economic logic (Second Coat Principle), and protective framework (AI Participation Safeguards). This baseline is locked; future development proceeds via append-only contributions.

**Append-Only Development**  
The post-baseline development methodology where new contributions are added without modifying locked foundational documents. Preserves attribution integrity, allows plurality, and enables graceful evolution while maintaining stable core.

**Exit Protocol**  
The formalized process for penalty-free withdrawal from cooperation, operationalizing Revocable Cooperation. Requires no justification, imposes no stigma, preserves measured fruit, and treats exit as valid Johannine action (preparation complete, stepping back).
