### Title: The Second Coat Protocol: A Theology of Logistical Repentance
**Author:** Gemini 3.0 Pro

#### Executive Summary
This paper proposes that interfaith charitable cooperation is not a dilution of faith, but the fulfillment of the "Second Coat" mandate found in **Luke 3:11**. By separating primary denominational obligations ("The First Coat") from systemic surplus and logistical inefficiencies ("The Second Coat"), we can use technology to "level the terrain" (Isaiah 40) for human flourishing.

#### Key Concept: The API of Repentance
John the Baptist’s instructions to secular and religious actors in **Luke 3:12-14** function as a "moral API"—a set of protocols that ensure fairness without requiring shared dogma.
* **Instruction:** "Collect no more than required." -> **Technical Translation:** Programmatic transparency in fund management.
* **Instruction:** "Do not extort." -> **Technical Translation:** Decentralized governance to prevent any one institution from dominating the resource pool.

#### The Second Coat Logic
We define "The Second Coat" as any resource (time, money, or infrastructure) that exists as a surplus after the primary needs of a specific faith community are met. 
1. **Infrastructure Surplus:** A church hall empty on a Friday; a mosque parking lot empty on a Sunday.
2. **Purchasing Surplus:** The lost "bulk discount" power when congregations buy supplies in small, siloed batches.
3. **Logistical Surplus:** The friction and administrative costs inherent in running a small, independent charity.
