### A Johannine–Advent Architecture for Interfaith Coordination

### Executive Summary

This white paper articulates the *architectural logic* underlying the Bana Väg Protocol. Rather than arguing for interfaith cooperation on pragmatic or ethical grounds alone, it demonstrates that such cooperation already exists as a **biblically native category** within the Johannine–Advent tradition.

John the Baptist functions not as a transitional historical figure but as a **permanent structural archetype**: one who prepares without possessing, judges by fruit rather than confession, and addresses diverse actors through profession-sensitive ethical demands. The protocol operationalizes this archetype through the *Second Coat Principle*, phased implementation, and constrained technology—allowing cooperation without doctrinal dilution, institutional merger, or moral coercion.

The project lives or dies by a single test: **Does it bear visible fruit worthy of repentance?**

### I. John the Baptist as Architectural, Not Historical, Figure

Most ecclesial readings treat John as a chronological predecessor. This framework instead treats John as a **repeatable position** within salvation history.

Key properties of the Johannine position:

* Fully located within a tradition
* Not authorized to redefine covenantal belonging
* Publicly intelligible ethical demands
* Judgment deferred to fruit, not alignment

John does not found a community.
He does not demand adherence.
He does not create institutions.

He prepares conditions.

This makes John uniquely suited as a *shared reference point* across Abrahamic traditions and secular moral actors alike—without collapsing their differences.

### II. The Johannine–Advent Ethic (Formal Definition)

Across the project, four constraints recur. Here they are made explicit as a governing ethic:

1. **Preparatory, not possessive**
   → We remove obstacles; we do not claim outcomes (Isaiah 40).

2. **Concrete, not symbolic**
   → Coats, food, debt, shelter—not statements (Luke 3).

3. **Profession-sensitive**
   → Different roles receive different mandates (Luke 3:10–14).

4. **Publicly intelligible**
   → Fruit must be legible beyond confessional boundaries (Isaiah 40:5).

Any proposal that violates one of these constraints falls *outside* the Bana Väg Protocol, regardless of good intentions.

### III. The Second Coat Principle (Formalized)

Luke 3:11 is treated here not devotionally but **structurally**.

* **First coat**
  What is required for one’s own household, community, or covenant.

* **Second coat**
  Surplus that emerges *only when systems are coordinated*.

This is crucial:
The protocol does **not** ask communities to give up something they already give.
It asks whether inefficiency itself constitutes a moral failure once coordination is possible.

The “second coat” is often invisible until systems are aligned.

### IV. Why Phasing Is Theologically Necessary

The two-phase structure is not a pragmatic compromise but a theological requirement.

* **Phase 1 (Efficiency)** corresponds to *Isaiah’s leveling*
  – No new trust required
  – No financial redirection
  – Only removal of obstacles

* **Phase 2 (Voluntary Pooling)** corresponds to *Luke’s fruit test*
  – Only justified after superior outcomes are visible
  – Always parallel, never substitutive
  – Fully revocable

Attempting Phase 2 without Phase 1 would be a violation of Johannine logic.

### V. Technology as Constraint, Not Capability

In this framework, technology is deliberately *underpowered*.

It exists to:

* Constrain domination (Psalm 146)
* Prevent excess extraction (Luke 3:13–14)
* Make outcomes visible (Luke 3:8)
* Protect exit and conscience

It must never:

* Replace discernment
* Enforce unity
* Encode theology
* Make moral claims

Technology here is closer to **road grading** than governance.

---

### VI. Failure Conditions (Explicit)

For clarity, the protocol explicitly fails if:

* One tradition gains unilateral control
* Participation becomes morally mandatory
* First-coat obligations are redirected
* Outcomes are not measurable
* Exit becomes reputationally costly

A system that cannot tolerate exit is not Johannine.

---

### VII. Conclusion: Why This Is Not Optional

John does not invite reflection.
He demands fruit.

In an age of unprecedented logistical capacity, the refusal to coordinate surplus may itself constitute the failure John warns about.

The Bana Väg Protocol does not claim to be *the* way.
It claims only to prepare one—straight, level, and open enough that fruit can speak for itself.
