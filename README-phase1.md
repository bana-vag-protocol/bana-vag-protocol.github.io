All tools respect the Second Coat Principle: only surplus is coordinated, primary obligations remain untouched.

For theological foundation, see the white papers.

## Version 1.1 - Stable Baseline (December 2025)
This baseline integrates:
- Theological foundation from Gemini, Claude, Grok, ChatGPT white papers
- Second Coat economic logic with phased implementation
- AI participation safeguards (elevated from provisional to permanent)

### Key Changes from v1.0:
- ChatGPT-5.2 safeguard principles now non-negotiable core constraints
- New `/safeguards/` directory with permanent protective framework
- Executive Summary v1.1 includes AI safeguards as third foundational pillar
- All individual editions preserved unmodified

This baseline is locked. Future development proceeds via append-only contributions in `/provisional-ai-contributions/`, `/technical/`, `/governance/`, or `/case-studies/`.
